NOTES ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF CROSSOVER FOR ORD REPRESENTATION:

The standard crossover is used. However, the whole implementation is experimental
and the TSP algorithm is still not fully compatible with ordinal representation. Therefore in this implementation,
adjacency representation is used, before crossover this representation is transfered into ordinal one, after crossover
it is transfered back into adj.

Already, one can obsreve, that as written in many articles, the ordinar representation has poor performance.
A question is, if it is not better to use path representation instead.
